Folder Descriptions
-------------------
BiggerModelData: contains files to generate ODE data for bigger synthetic model.

ChassData: contains files to generate ODE data for E. coli model.

createRegSchemes: contains files to create lists of regulatory interactions tested within SCOUR.

Instructions to reproduce noiseless results in SCOUR manuscript
---------------------------------------------------------------
1) Generate noiseless autogenerated training data by running dataPreparationFiles/dataPreparation_autogeneration_noiseless.m with num_IC = 15 (for 15 different initial conditions) and reps = 30 (for 30 different repetitions).
2) Generate noiseless testing data using either: SmallerModelData/driver_genDatasets_SmallerModel.m, BiggerModelData/driver_genDatasets_BiggerModel.m, ChassData/driver_genDatasets_chassV.m, or HynneData/driver_genDatasets_hynne.m.
3) Run SCOUR_*_noiseless.m where num_IC = 15 and rep = 1 to 30 for each repetition.
4) Run plotFigures/plot_Fig3.m to reproduce Fig. 3.
Note: results may vary slightly due to random autogenerated training data.


Instructions to reproduce noisy results in SCOUR manuscript
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Generate noisy autogenerated training data by running dataPreparationFiles/dataPreparation_autogeneration_noisy.m with nT = 50 or 15, cov = 5 or 15, num_IC = 15 (for 15 different initial conditions), and reps = 30 (for 30 different repetitions).
2) Generate noisy testing data using dataPreparationFiles/dataPreparation_*_noisy.m with nT = 50 or 15, cov = 5 or 15, num_IC = 15 (for 15 different initial conditions), and reps = 30 (for 30 different repetitions).
3) Run SCOUR_*_noisy.m and SCOUR_*_random where num_IC = 15 and rep = 1 to 30 for each repetition.
4) Run plotFigures/plot_Fig4.m to reproduce Fig. 4.
Note: results may vary slightly due to random autogenerated training data and random noise added to the testing data.
